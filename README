Personal Statement Maker
by Winnie Liu

Description
---
A make file to automatically generate multiple personal statements.


Motivation
---
When you are applying for serveral schools, you will find that you have
to write a specified paragraph (your "school paragraph") for each school
and generate the pdf file respectively.

I want to write an automation tool to free you from this kind of trivial
compling and configuring efforts.


How to use it
---

* files layout: 

  personal_statement_maker
  |
  |-- configure.py
  |-- Makefile
  |-- school_list            (configuration file)
  |-- src
      |-- template.tex
      |-- PhD.tex            (your general paragraphs)
      |-- <school_name>.tex  (your school paragraph; the school name SHOUL be in the school_list)
      |-- <school_name>.tex 
      |-- ...
  |-- build
      |-- <school_name>.pdf   (your generated pdf file)
      |-- ...

* usage:
  - BACKUP your writtings!!!!!!!!!!! (or use git!)
  - write your school list based on the guidance below
  - make sure that you have a "template.tex" under the directory "src"
  - generate the makefile:
    ./configure.py
  - make all: generate all personal statements
  - make [<school name> <school name> ...]: getnerate the specified personal statements
  - make clean: clean the dubug and log file of latex


Configuration
---

The school_list is a configuration file in YAML format.

example:

CMU:
    Title: Personal Statement
    headline1: miao
    inputLineStretch: 1.0
HKUST:
    Title: dslfjsd
    

Items under the schoolname is SHOULD begin with a TAB (just like the Makefile)
